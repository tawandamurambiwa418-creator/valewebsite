          <strong>Valentine Date:</strong>I can’t be with you in person, but that doesn’t mean we can’t celebrate it. I want to tell you how much you mean to me, but it all ends up stuck in my throat because it’s just so much.

I love you so much, and I don’t even know how to fully express it. I’m tongue-tied, failing to put it into words, but still hoping it lands the way I mean it.
You’ve been the best. Literally the best everything.
The best girlfriend.
The best friend ever.
The best person to go to when I can’t deal with everything.
It’s funny — I hear my mom, actually my whole family, always saying I’m strong, even when I’m not. And you’re the one and only person who has ever accepted me for who I am… for what I am… my baggage and all. And I don’t even know how to fully explain what that means to me.
We have all these fights, and I just want to tell you that I’m happy we even have them. We haven’t given up on each other, even when it feels heavy sometimes.
Despite everything that’s happened, I want you to know that my life has been significantly better with you in it.
You are my best friend.
The one person I truly want to confide in.
I love you so much Susan Kapaya
